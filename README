Objective: Simplify complex sentences by separating the sentence clauses into separate simple sentences.

This code uses Stanford NLP Parser and therefore, inherits its license limitations. 
It was motivated by L. Del Corro and R. Gemulla approach
(https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~rgemulla/publications/delcorro13clausie.pdf)
but uses the newest version of Stanford NLP at the time of developpement (3.5.2).
